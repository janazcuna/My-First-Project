# My-First-Project
I will be making a guess the number project.

Here's a quick explanation of how it works: the game is all about guessing a number between 1 and 100. We start by splitting the range in half, so the first guess is 100/2 = 50. The game then asks if your number is higher, lower, or equal to the guess, and it keeps adjusting until we land on the right number.
