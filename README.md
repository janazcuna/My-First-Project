# My-First-Project
I will be making a guess the number project.

A quick explanation, how guess a number works. To begin, this game is based on guessing a number between 1-100, we will always divide the whole number in //2 . First time we will divide 100/2 = 50 . So the game will ask is your number greater, lower or equal to the number, and so on until number is guessed.
